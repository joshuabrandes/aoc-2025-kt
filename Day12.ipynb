       "<p>You're almost out of time, but there can't be much left to decorate. Although there are no stairs, elevators, escalators, tunnels, chutes, teleporters, firepoles, or conduits here that would take you deeper into the North Pole base, there <em>is</em> a ventilation duct. You jump in.</p> \n",
       "<p>After bumping around for a few minutes, you emerge into a large, well-lit cavern full of Christmas trees!</p> \n",
       "<p>There are a few Elves here frantically decorating before the deadline. They think they'll be able to finish most of the work, but the one thing they're worried about is the <em>presents</em> for all the young Elves that live here at the North Pole. It's an ancient tradition to put the presents under the trees, but the Elves are worried they won't <em>fit</em>.</p> \n",
       "<p>The presents come in a few standard but very weird shapes. The shapes and the regions into which they need to fit are all measured in standard <em>units</em>. To be aesthetically pleasing, the presents need to be placed into the regions in a way that follows a standardized two-dimensional unit grid; you also can't stack presents.</p> \n",
       "<p>As always, the Elves have a summary of the situation (your puzzle input) for you. First, it contains a list of the presents' shapes. Second, it contains the size of the region under each tree and a list of the number of presents of each shape that need to fit into that region. For example:</p> \n",

Each line starts with the width and length of the region; <code>12x5</code> means the region is <code>12</code> units wide and <code>5</code> units long. The rest of the line describes the presents that need to fit into that region by listing the <em>quantity of each shape</em> of present; <code>1 0 1 0 3 2</code> means you need to fit one present with shape index 0, no presents with shape index 1, one present with shape index 2, no presents with shape index 3, three presents with shape index 4, and two presents with shape index 5.</p> \n",
       "<p>Presents can be <em>rotated and flipped</em> as necessary to make them fit in the available space, but they have to always be placed perfectly on the grid. Shapes can't overlap (that is, the <code>#</code> part from two different presents can't go in the same place on the grid), but they <em>can</em> fit together (that is, the <code>.</code> part in a present's shape's diagram does not block another present from occupying that space on the grid).</p> \n",
       "<p>The Elves need to know <em>how many of the regions</em> can fit the presents listed. In the above example, there are six unique present shapes and three regions that need checking.</p> \n",
